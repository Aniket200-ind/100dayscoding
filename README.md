# #100dayscoding in Rust

I going to start a 100 days coding challenge in Rust as I start to learn it

## Uses of Rust

Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory, without requiring the use of automated memory management techniques, such as garbage collection.

Rust is a general-purpose, open-source programming language that is used in various domains such as web development, game development, data science, virtual reality, and blockchain development. Even many compilers for JavaScript are designed in Rust for better performance. Like the Turbopack library used by NextJS and GatsbyJS is written in Rust.

## Why Rust?

Rust is being voted as most loved language on **Stack Overflow** survey for 8 years in a row. This challenge is to learn Rust and to get familiar with it.
