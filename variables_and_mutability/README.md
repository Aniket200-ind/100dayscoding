# Variables and Mutablility

> In **Rust**, `let` keyword is used to declare a variable.

```rust
let x = 5;
```

## Properties of variables

- Variables are immutable by default.

- As other programming languages, variables are block scoped.

- We cannot used specific keywords as variable names.

- Snake case naming convention is used for naming varibles in Rust.

## Mutability

`mut` keyword is used to declare a mutable variable.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut x = 5;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
    x = 6;
    println!("The value of x is: {}", x);
}
```

> Well as a JavaScript developer I find it odd how Rust does the variable declaration. As in JavaScript `let` is used for declaring mutable variables and `const` is used for declaring immutable variables.

## Constants

Constants are declared using the `const` keyword instead of `let`, and the type of the value **must** be annotated.

```rust
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 1_00_000;
```

### Why use constants?üßê

But the question arises why we need constants when we are declaring an immutable variable by default.

Well naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also helps to have only one place in your code you would need to change if the hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.

## Shadowing

When you use the same name for a new variable as an old one, the old one gets hidden by the new one. This is called shadowing in Rust. The compiler will only see the new variable when you use that name. The new variable takes over the name until it gets hidden by another variable or the scope ends.

```rust
let a = 23;
let a = a - 3;
{
    let a = a / 2;
    println!("The value of a in the scope is: {}", a);
    // Prints 10
}
println!("The value of a outside the scope is: {}", a);
// Prints 20
```

The other difference between mutating a variable and shadowing is that because we‚Äôre effectively creating a new variable when we use the let keyword again, we can change the type of the value but reuse the same name.
