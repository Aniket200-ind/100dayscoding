# Day 15 - Rust Car Factory Simulation

## Description

This project is a simple simulation of a car factory written in Rust. It demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in Rust, such as structs and enums, as well as the use of external crates.

## Concepts Used

- **Structs**: The `Car` struct is used to represent a car with properties like color, car type, transmission type, whether it's convertible, and brand.
- **Enums**: The `Transmission` enum is used to represent the type of transmission a car can have: Manual, SemiAuto, or Automatic.
- **External Crates**: The `capitalize` crate is used to capitalize user input.

## Detailed Description

The program starts by asking the user to enter the number of cars they want to create. Then, for each car, the user is asked to enter the car's color, car type, transmission type, whether it's convertible, and brand. The program then prints out the details of each car.
