# Yew Starter App

- This small static webpage is build using Yew.rs.

- Yew is a modern Rust framework for creating multithreaded front-end web apps with WebAssembly. It features a completely new type-safe, macro-based way of creating reusable components. It is inspired by Elm, React and Redux.

- Therefore, while building web apps with Yew, you can feel like you are building a web app with React and Redux, but in Rust.

## How to run this app?

- First you need to install Rust and Cargo. You can install it from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

 - Then visit yew's official website and follow the instructions to install wasm-pack and cargo-generate. You can find the instructions [here](https://yew.rs/docs/getting-started/introduction).

- After installing all the required packages, you can run this app by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
trunk serve
```
